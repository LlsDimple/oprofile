# ppc64 POWER8 possible unit masks
#
# NOTE: The 'rc_machine' and 'L1_latency' unit masks are for internal use only,
#       to workaround oprofile's 32-bit limitation for event codes.
#       See libpe_utils/op_pe_utils.cpp:_get_event_code for how these codes are
#       used.

#note 1.   11/12/2015
#
# Some event requires the cache selector bits to be set to a non-zero
# value in the processor performance counter setup register.  On Power 8, this
# register is only writable by the hypervisor.  So the kernel must reject any
# event where the lower three cache selector bits (bits 22:20) are not equal
# to 0.  If/when an API is implemented to allow the kernel to request the
# hypervisor write the register with the required value, these events can be
# re-added to the list of supported events.  The issue is documented in the
# powerpc kernel file arch/powerpc/perf/power8-pmu.c in function power8_get_constraint()
# where the cache bits are ANDed with 0x7 if the unit is between 6 and 9.  If
# cache bits are not zero, the function returns -1 to reject the event.
#
# The associated unit masks for these problem events are unused and also need
# to be commented out.
